Is an array that is sorted in Ascending order a min-oriented heap? Why?
Ans. Min sorted array is min-oriented heap. Since an array which is in ascending order, its elements are in order such that the first node consists of elements which consists of elements which is minimum in the whole heap.
For example:
Suppose the array is: A B C D E F G H
Then the tree diagram is:
									A
								B			C
							C	 	D 	E 		F
						G		H
The above shows that array sorted in Ascending order is a min-oriented heap.
